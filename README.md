# Programming for lovers

This project contains my notes and homework assignments from the Programming is for lovers course

### Running tests with code coverage
to run the test suite, execute `go test -race -count=1 -cover ./...` from the root of the project.
- pass the `update` flag to rewrite the golden files

```console
üçü üåÑ : go test -race -count=1 -cover ./...
?   	github.com/JoshuaMorris/programming-for-lovers/lectures/lecture-1-go-basics/conditionals	[no test files]
ok  	github.com/JoshuaMorris/programming-for-lovers/lectures/lecture-1-go-basics/gcd	18.438s	coverage: 100.0% of statements
?   	github.com/JoshuaMorris/programming-for-lovers/lectures/lecture-1-go-basics/intro	[no test files]
?   	github.com/JoshuaMorris/programming-for-lovers/lectures/lecture-1-go-basics/loops	[no test files]
ok  	github.com/JoshuaMorris/programming-for-lovers/lectures/lecture-1-go-basics/primes	1.109s	coverage: 100.0% of statements
ok  	github.com/JoshuaMorris/programming-for-lovers/testutils	1.073s	coverage: 100.0% of statements

```
 

### running function benchmarks
To run the function benchmarks, execute `go test ./... -bench=.` from the root of the project

```console
üçè üåÑ : go test ./... -bench=.
